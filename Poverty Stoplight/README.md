# Poverty Stoplight Projects ‚Äì Fundaci√≥n Paraguaya

This repository contains my work with the **Poverty Stoplight** initiative by Fundaci√≥n Paraguaya, a social innovation tool that enables families to self-diagnose their level of poverty across multiple dimensions. My contributions are organized into two major projects:

---

## üìä 1. Data Analysis for LLM Tuning

**Folder:** `LLM Tuning Data`

This project focuses on preparing high-quality data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) that supports the Poverty Stoplight's diagnostic tool. The goal is to enable the LLM to more effectively assess and identify key poverty indicators and their root causes.

### Highlights:
- Cleaned and structured real-world data from household surveys
- Developed labeled datasets representing poverty indicators and thresholds
- Engineered features and context formats tailored for LLM input
- Aimed to enhance model interpretability and alignment with human-assessed outcomes

## üåê 2. Poverty Stoplight vs. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Comparison

**Folder:** `Comparison Site`

This web-based project visualizes and compares how the Poverty Stoplight framework aligns and differs from the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)**, a commonly used global standard.

### Highlights:
- Developed an interactive site for side-by-side comparison
- Mapped indicators between Poverty Stoplight and MPI dimensions
